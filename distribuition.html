    <title>Getting the WWW files</title>

<body>
    <h1>the WWW files</h1>
    <p>this if you have not yet got the WWW files you need, and you cannot NFS mount a directory on which they reside.</p>
    <p>source and binary of WWW project files are currently available (see copyright ) by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch. This node is currently 128.141.201.74 but THIS MAY CHANGE. The files are compressed tape archive files (.tar.Z). To get a file using anonymous FTP, use user name "anonymous", and your email address as a password:-</p>
    <ol>
        <li>ftp info.cern.ch</li>
        <li>Enter user name: anonymous</li>
        <li>Password: me@myhost.edu</li>
        <li>ftp> cd /pub/www/src</li>
        <li>ftp> binary</li>
        <li>ftp> get WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z</li>
        <li> quit</li>
        <li>></li>
    </ol>       
    <p>The file name will depend on the product you want. Here vvv is the version number of the software.</p>
    <p>Once you have the compressed tar file, you must uncompress it and unwrap it.</p>   
    <ul>uncompress WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z</ul>
    <p>This will make a rather larger file with the name without the ".Z". To unwrap it,</p>
    <ul>tar xvf WWWLineMode_vvv.tar</ul>
    <p>you should install the line mode browser , install the server , install Viola , etc.</p>
